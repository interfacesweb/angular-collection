<!--
     Inside this directive you should display the ITEMS available in the collection object.
     Depending on the TYPE property of the collection, the items will be:
     
   - books
   - movies
   - videogames
   - music albums

     This directive should display the right directive for each collection type (c.collection.type). E.g. if it is a "books" collection, the directive "items-books" must be displayed, showing the books in the appropriate format; if it is a "movies" collection, the directive "items-movies" must be displayed, showing the movies in the appropriate format.

     Each item must have two links/buttons: one for building the edit template and one for deleting the item.
     
     When the user clicks on the "edit" button, the function "buildEditForm" must be called to create the edit template, fill it with the item data and store it in "c.collection.editTemplate".
     
     When the user clicks on the "delete" button, the function "deleteItem" must be called.
     
     You can change all the HTML in this page.
